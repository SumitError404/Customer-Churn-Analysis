# Customer-Churn-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn behavior and building predictive models to forecast customer churn for a telecommunications company. Customer churn occurs when customers stop using a companyâ€™s service, leading to revenue loss. Predicting churn enables businesses to proactively retain customers through targeted interventions.  The project utilizes a realistic synthetic dataset representing telecom customer data with various demographic, service, and account-related features. Machine learning techniques are applied to classify whether a customer is likely to churn based on these features.
